# Screen Picker Package

Truffle package enabling polling by letting viewers select a point on screen. Currently, there are two separate embeds: The viewer embed facilitates the actual poll (overlay on video) and the admin embed controls creating/managing the polls. The overlay runs on port `5173` by default and the admin embed on `5174`. Below are the corresponding dev embed configs. An authentication token is needed in both cases (to manage permissions and ensure each viewer can only vote once).

### Why Firebase instead of Supabase?

A rewrite to use Supabase has been started in [dev/supabase](/truffle-screen-picker/tree/dev/supabase), however, the Supabase free tier only allows 200 concurrent realtime connections.

## [Viewer embed](viewer-embed)

```json
{
  "url": "http://localhost:5173/",
  "authToken": "AUTH_TOKEN",
  "parentQuerySelector": "#player",
  "contentPageType": "youtube",
  "defaultStyles": {
    "height": "100%",
    "width": "100%",
    "position": "absolute",
    "top": "0px",
    "left": "0px",
    "mix-blend-mode": "hard-light"
  }
}
```

## [Admin embed](admin-embed)

Ideally, this would not be an embed, but perhaps accessible via the creator website?

```json
{
  "url": "http://localhost:5174/",
  "authToken": "AUTH_TOKEN",
  "parentQuerySelector": "#above-the-fold",
  "contentPageType": "youtube",
  "defaultStyles": {
    "height": "428px",
    "width": "100%"
  }
}
```

## [Poll results](results-visualizer)

Result are shown on a separate page, which connects to the Realtime Database. Note that at least 10 votes are needed in order to see something, as otherwise the k-means algorithm used produces trash. You can either access the visualization via a permalink to a specific poll

    https://truffle-demos.firebaseapp.com/pollResults?pollId=YOUR_POLL_ID

or open

    https://truffle-demos.firebaseapp.com/latestPollResults?orgId=YOUR_ORG_ID

which redirects to the latest poll of the specified org.

# Backend

Business logic, databases and hosting are handled with Firebase. A Realtime Database stores the poll entries and Firestore saves what polls exists and which are currently active. Hosting is needed to serve the page showing the poll results, which can be added as a browser source in OBS.

# Simulate entries

To create mock database entries (votes) for debugging, check out [simulate-votes](simulate-votes).
