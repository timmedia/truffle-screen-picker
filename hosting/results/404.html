    <h1>Not found</h1>
    <p>
      Either you tried to access a path that doesn't exist, or you have been
      redirected here because the poll you are looking for does not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter might happen if you try to access <code>/latest</code> for an
      org that has yet to create their first poll.
